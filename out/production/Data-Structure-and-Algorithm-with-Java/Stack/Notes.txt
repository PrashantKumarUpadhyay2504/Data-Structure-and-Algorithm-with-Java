1.Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. 

2.The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).

3.Some of its main operations are:
 a)push()
 b)pop()
 c)top() or peek()
 d)isEmpty()
 e)isFull()
 f)size()
 
 a)Push: Adds an item to the stack. If the stack is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition.
 
 b)Pop: Removes an item from the stack. The items are popped in the reversed order in which they are pushed. 
 If the stack is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition.
 
 c)Peek or Top: Returns the top element of the stack.
 
 d)isEmpty: Returns true if the stack is empty, else false.
 
 4.push(), pop(), isEmpty() and peek() all take O(1) time. We do not run any loop in any of these operations.
